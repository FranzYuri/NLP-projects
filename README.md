# NLP-projects
This repository gathers my work in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including both:

- **Coursework projects** developed as part of the *Advanced Learning for Text and Graph Data (ALTEGRAD)* course at IPP
- **Independent projects** exploring NLP techniques, models, and applications

Each subfolder contains a self-contained project with code, documentation, and relevant experiments.
